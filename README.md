Repo for the submission of the course project for the "**Getting and Cleaning Data**" course

# Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#  Project Summary

You should create one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
1. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Dependencies

The **plyr** is required to run **run_analysis.R** script.
